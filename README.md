# Titanic Data Analysis
*Survival predict based on data*

>The Titanic dataset provides a detailed account of the passengers aboard the ill-fated ship that sank on April 15, 1912. The data includes information on the passengers' demographics, such as age, gender, passenger class, and embarkation port, as well as their survival status.
>
>After analyzing the data, several trends emerge. The most significant factor that influenced survival was gender, with females having a much higher survival rate than males. Age was also a significant factor, with children having a higher survival rate than adults. Passenger class also played a role, with first-class passengers having a higher survival rate than second or third-class passengers.
>
>The size of the passenger's family also played a role in survival, with those traveling alone having a lower survival rate than those traveling with family members. Embarkation port also had a small effect on survival, with passengers who embarked from Cherbourg having a higher survival rate than those who embarked from Queenstown or Southampton.
>
>Overall, the analysis suggests that the profile most likely to survive was a young female passenger traveling in first class with 1-3 family members, and embarked from Cherbourg.

*However, it is important to note that these conclusions are based on the available data and may not be representative of the entire population of Titanic passengers.*
